## About

Originally hosted on `breakuprecoveryguide.com`, this website was really important to me, as it was fundamentally different from most of the breakup advice websites I'd encountered.

The creator put an extraordinary amount of care into it, helping people navigate different phases of the recovery process and organizing the guidance into descriptive and genuinely helpful topicsâ€”from the immediate aftermath to the complete recovery journey. Unlike other resources that offered generic platitudes, this website provided honest, detailed, and practical advice that actually acknowledged the real pain people experience.

When I went through a breakup from a 10-year relationship, it hit me really hard. Nothing felt easy during that time, but this website genuinely improved my life. It didn't promise quick fixes or tell me everything would be fineâ€”it gave me real tools and understanding for what I was going through.

Unfortunately, the website simply disappeared one day. I believe the creator vanished or something happened to them, because it never came back online. All we had left were some archived pages scattered across the Internet Archive.

## Problems

The archived version had significant issues that made it nearly unusable:
- Broken CSS and formatting that made pages hard to read
- Missing images and broken layouts
- Inconsistent navigation between sections
- Poor text contrast and accessibility issues
- No easy way for people to discover this valuable resource

More importantly, even if someone managed to find these archived pages, they'd have to navigate through the Internet Archive's interface and deal with all the formatting problems that made the content difficult to access when people needed it most.

## Solution

I decided to scrape all the pages I could find from the archive and restore this website to its original functionality. This preservation project involved:

**Content Recovery:**
- Extracting over 70 HTML pages from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine
- Recovering content in three languages: English, Spanish, and Portuguese
- Preserving the original structure and organization that made this resource so effective

**Technical Restoration:**
- Fixed broken CSS and layout issues that made the archived version nearly unreadable
- Restored proper navigation between sections and languages
- Improved text contrast and readability throughout the site
- Enhanced accessibility for people using screen readers or other assistive technologies
- Created a clean, modern landing page while preserving the original design aesthetic

**Preservation Infrastructure:**
- Added proper attribution system crediting the original creator
- Created archive notices explaining the preservation effort
- Ensured the website works consistently across different devices and browsers
- Maintained the multilingual support that made this resource accessible to Spanish and Portuguese speakers

## Why This Mattered

This website represented something rare: honest, detailed guidance that didn't minimize the real pain of relationship loss. The creator understood that breakupsâ€”especially from long-term relationshipsâ€”can be genuinely devastating, and they created content that met people where they were emotionally rather than where society thought they should be.

When someone is going through the worst emotional pain of their life, they don't need empty reassurances. They need practical tools, understanding of what they're experiencing, and a roadmap for genuine recovery. This website provided exactly that.

By preserving and restoring it, I hope others who are struggling can access this resource when they need it most, without having to navigate broken archives or deal with formatting issues that make an already difficult time even harder.

The original creator put tremendous care into helping people heal. The least I could do was ensure their work remained accessible to those who need it.
